  Project aimed to contribute to open-source community developing facility-location solutions. Together with JAmes Gaboardi, Qunshan Zhao, Levi John Wolf and I developed four models: P-Center, P-Median, LSCP and MCLP. The module was tested and integrated to [spopt](https://github.com/pysal/spopt) using PyTest and Github Actions. You can see my final submmission report [here](https://gist.github.com/gegen07/576dcdfad046cc91246bdb3ea3a47ce1).
