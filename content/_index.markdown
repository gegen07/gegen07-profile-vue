## Germano Barcelos - Master Comp Sci Student

### Who am I?
Hello, I am Germano Barcelos a Master Computer Science Student at UFV studying Deep Learning to model Human Mobility Patterns. My journey in Data Science began in 2019 when I joined into [NESPED-Lab](https://nesped.caf.ufv.br/) as an Undergradute Research to study about geospatial data enrichment. There I developed the package [MoreData](https://github.com/NESPEDUFV/more-data) which uses OpenStreetMap, Geopandas and others tools to provide an ease way to enrich data from different databases. In 2021, I participated in [GSoC](https://gist.github.com/gegen07/576dcdfad046cc91246bdb3ea3a47ce1) developing Spatial Optimization (Location Set Covering, P-Center, P-Median and Maximal Covering Set Models) models. When GSoC finished I joined into the developers team of PySAL which is the organization that I contributed for, specifically to [spopt](github.com/pysal/spopt) project. 

#### My Interests
Semantic Enrichment, Deep Learning, Human Mobility, Spatial Optimization, Machine Learning


### Random Topic

Below there is the most beautiful formulas created by Newton but is used in Human Mobility to study shifting patterns. As the __Tobler's First Law of Geography__ states: "_everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things_".
`$$X_{ij}=G\frac{Y_i^{\beta_1}Y_j^{\beta_2}}{d_{ij}^{\beta_3}}$$`
